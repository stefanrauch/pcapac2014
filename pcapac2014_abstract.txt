Titel: Managing Multiple Function Generators for FAIR

In the FAIR control system, equipment which needs to be controlled with ramped nominal values (e.g. power converters) is controlled by a standard front-end control unit (SCU). An SCU combines a ComExpressBoard with Intel CPU and an FPGA baseboard and acts as bus-master on the SCU host-bus. Up to 12 function generators can be implemented in slave-board FPGAs and can be controlled from one SCU.

The real-time data supply for the generators demands a special software/hardware approach. Direct control of the generators with a FESA (front-end control software) class, running on an Intel Atom CPU with Linux, does not meet the timing requirements. So an extra layer with an LM32 soft-core CPU is added to the FPGA. Communication between Linux and the LM32 is done via shared memory and a ring buffer data structure. The LM32 supplies the function generators with new parameter sets when it is triggered by interrupts. This two-step approach decouples the Linux CPU from the hard real-time requirements. For synchronous start and coherent clocking of all function generators, special pins on the SCU backplane are being used to avoid bus latencies.
